# Module 2. Authentication and Credential Management

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, developers will be able to:

- Implement secure authentication mechanisms including SSO, MFA, and OpenID
- Apply proper credential lifecycle management practices
- Implement secure session management with appropriate cookie attributes
- Securely handle JWT tokens with proper validation and security controls

---

2.1 What is Authentication?
- The process of verifying an identity
- Attributes used for verifying an identity
- Various authentication methods (SSO, MFA, OpenID)

2.2 Entities that need authentication
- Devices
- Applications
- Humans
- Services
- Docker images
- Containers

2.3 Credential Lifecycle Management
- Credential Provisioning
- Credential Rotation  
- Credential Revocation  
- Secure Credential Recovery

2.4 Password / token management
- storage (embedded or otherwise)
- privacy implications
- complexity
- lifetime and rotation of password
- reuse / sharing of password
- expiry
- validation
- password guessing / brute-forceable password

2.5 Session Management
- Session timeout and renewal
- Cookie attributes: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite
- Token vs. cookie-based sessions
- Logout and re-authentication
- Fixation and hijacking defenses

2.6 Using tokens such as json web tokens
- Signatures and algorithms
- Mandatory fields on the tokens that include security
- Sensitive information in the payload and security implications

2.7 Test authentication
