The structure of the curriculum is finalised at the moment.

The curriculum takes the following structure:
1. The name of the topic
2. sub topics

the topics are the ones that we would expect a developer to know.
For example a developer, at a foundation level, needs to know about threat modelling. But they may not necessarily know how to threat model. Hence adding content around threat modelling may not add to the body of knowledge.
