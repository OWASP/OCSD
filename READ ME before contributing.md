Hi :-) 

Welcome to the OCSD Curriculum project.

#Currently we follow the below mentioned structure for the markdown files in the curriculum:\ 
#The curriculum takes the following structure:\ 
#1. The domain ( for example 01. Security Architecture and Threat Modelling)\ 
#Each domain has \
#1. Topic (the rubric includes the numbering and the name)\ 
#2. Sub topics (the relationship between a topic and sub topics is 1 : 0..many)\ 

#The topics are the high level security constructs that a developer would be expected to know.\ 
#For example a developer, at a foundation level, needs to know about threat modelling. But they may not necessarily know how to threat model. Hence adding content around threat modelling may not add to the body of knowledge. But adding sub-topics on what a developer needs to know about threat modelling will help.\ 

#Each domain has a dedicated folder.\ 
#Each folder has a main *.md file that is meant to have curriculum for the domain\ 
#There is a second *.md file that contains content for reading. Where available, this material can be used to derive curriculum.\ 
#The third *.md file is for references. \ 
    #It would be very helpful if you could add reading material / references from OWASP repositories.\ 
    #If you would like to add any other open source (not copyrighted) please watch out for the license. MIT and Apache 2.0 may be ok, but I would not go for any CC-BY-4, where an attribution would be required.\ 
#the fourth *.md file is a README file, which is currently empty.\ 

#please let me (shruti kulkarni) know if you have any questions\
