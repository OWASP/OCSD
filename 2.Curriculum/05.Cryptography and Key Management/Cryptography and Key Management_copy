## Module 5: Cryptography and Key Management

### Common algorithm pitfalls

* Always use Authenticated Encryption (AEAD)
* Know what AEAD is
* Know common examples of AEAD modes (GCM, CCM, OCB, Chacha20-Poly1305)
* Prefer integrated AEAD modes over custom-built
* When doing AEAD manually, use Encrypt-then-MAC
* Prefer ChaCha20 on lightweight/embedded devices over AES
* Nonce must be unique per key and plaintext combination
* Never use a static nonce
* An Initialization Vector (IV) needs to be unpredictable (=random)
* Nonce and IV don't need to be secret
* Do not use symmetric keys < 128 bit
* Do not use Hash Algorithms older that SHA-2
* Use HMAC when requiring a MAC, nothing custom-built
* Use OEAP (=PKCS#1 v2.0) mode when doing RSA encryption
* Use PSS (=PKCS#1 v2.1) model when doing RSA signatures
* Do not reuse keys for multiple purposes
* Use dedicated schemes for password hashing, not standard hash functions like SHA-2
* Parameters for password-hashes need to be adapted regularly according to industry recommendations
* Always use a salt when hashing passwords
* Salt does not have to be secret
* Salt has to be unique per user
* Base64 is no encryption algorithm
* Do not use cipher suites with CBC, RSA, (3)DES in TLS, harden against industry recommendations (e.g., Mozilla)
   

### Secure random number generation

* Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG) produce deterministic output
* A PRNG needs to be seeded with actual random numbers
* A PRNG needs to be re-seeded periodically
* True Random Number Generators (TRNG) use physical observations to produce random numbers
* TRNGs are too slow for actual usage
* Always use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) when doing security-relevant things
* Operating Systems provide secure APIs for generating secure Random numbers. Those should be the preferred way of generating random numbers.
* The OS takes care of seeding and re-seeding its CSPRNG automatically
* Use /dev/urandom on Unix-based systems
* Use BCryptGenRandom() on Windows
* Most development Frameworks offer an API with a CSPRNG; they usually have "Secure" or "Crypto" in its name
* The Framework takes care of seeding and re-seeding its CSPRNG automatically
* Do not use RNG APIs without "Secure" or "Crypto" in its name
* A well seeded CSRPNG can produce unlimited output

### Key lifecycle and storage

* Base64 encoded keys are not encrypted
* Make sure to set file ACL appropriately when storing a secret key in a file
* Prefer using OS-API for key management to doing this manually
* Secret keys stored in a file should preferably be encrypted with a key derived from a user-supplied password
* Secret keys from a hardware token can usually not be exported
* Secret keys generated on a hardware token won't have a backup available
* All keys should have a well-defined lifetime and be rotated at the end of the lifetime
* Common lifetimes for certain key sizes can be found in industry recommendations
* The more often a key is used, the shorter its lifetime should be
* The shorter the size of a key, the shorter its lifetime should be
* Access to a key needs to be restricted according to the principle of least privilege
* When rotating a symmetric key, all data encrypted with the old key needs to be re-encrypted

### Digital signatures and HMACs

* MACs are symmetric algorithm
* Digital signatures are asymmetric algorithms
* When using a MAC, everyone who can verify a signature can also create one
* When using a digital signature, people who can verify a signature cannot create one
* A digital signature is created with a private key
* A digital signature is verified with a public key
* A MAC is created with a secret key
* A MAC is verified with a secret key
* MACs are faster the digital signatures
* Always verify the signature before using the signed data
* Elliptic curve based schemes have smaller key- and signature-sizes than RSA
* Prefer Ed25519 (EdDSA) over ECDSA
* (X.509) certificates combine a public key with metadata about the key's owner
* (X.509) certificates are digitally signed by a trusted entity
* X.509 certificates are digitally signed by Certification Authority (CA)
