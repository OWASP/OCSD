# Module 10. Malicious Code and Software Supply Chain Security including usage of open source software

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, developers will be able to:

- Implement comprehensive input validation and output encoding strategies
- Implement secure deserialization and domain security controls
- Manage software dependencies securely using SCA tools
- Evaluate and select open source software with security and licensing considerations

---

10.1 Vulnerabilities in applications - web, mobile, low-code-no-code, etc.
- SQL / LDAP / OS injection
- XSS
- CSRF
- SSRF
- broken authorisation
- session hijacking

10.2 Secure coding to ensure vulnerabilities do not materialise:
- parametrisation of queries
- input data validation
- data typing
- scheme verification
- content security policy
- HTTP header hardening

10.2 Secure deserialization

10.3 Domains
- Subdomain takeover

10.4 Dependency management (SCA tools like OWASP Dependency-Check)             
- Code signing and verification
- Open source software and licensing
- Selecting open source software

10.5 Testing applications for vulnerabilities

10.6 Testing open source software
