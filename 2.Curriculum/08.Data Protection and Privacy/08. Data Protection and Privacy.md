# Module 8. Data Protection and Privacy

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, developers will be able to:

- Implement data classification and handling procedures based on sensitivity levels
- Apply encryption and protection techniques for data at rest and in use
- Implement data minimization and anonymization techniques
- Design and implement secure data deletion and retention policies
- Understand regulatory requirements and translate them into technical controls

---

## 8.1 Data Classification and Handling

### Data Classification Levels

- Public data
- Internal data
- Confidential data
- Restricted/Highly sensitive data

### Classification-Based Controls

- Access controls per classification level
- Encryption requirements by data type
- Storage and transmission requirements
- Retention and disposal policies

### Data Inventory and Discovery

- Identifying sensitive data in applications
- Data flow mapping
- Automated data discovery tools

---

## 8.2 Data Encryption at Rest

### Encryption Strategies

- Full disk encryption
- Database encryption (TDE)
- File-level encryption
- Field-level encryption for sensitive columns

### Key Management for Data at Rest

- Encryption key storage
- Key rotation procedures
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- Cloud key management services

### Implementation Considerations

- Performance impact
- Searchability of encrypted data
- Backup and recovery procedures

---

## 8.3 Data Minimization

### Principles

- Collect only necessary data
- Limit data retention periods
- Reduce data copies and replicas
- Purpose limitation

### Implementation Techniques

- Data collection forms review
- API response filtering
- Log data reduction
- Database schema design for minimization

---

## 8.4 Anonymization and Pseudonymization

### Anonymization Techniques

- Data masking
- Generalization
- Data swapping
- Noise addition

### Pseudonymization

- Tokenization
- Hashing with salt
- Encryption-based pseudonymization
- Reversible vs irreversible techniques

### Testing Data Protection

- Using anonymized data in test environments
- Synthetic data generation
- Data subset creation

---

## 8.5 Secure Data Deletion

### Deletion Methods

- Secure overwriting
- Cryptographic erasure
- Physical destruction
- Cloud data deletion verification

### Deletion Considerations

- Backup data deletion
- Cached and replicated data
- Third-party data sharing
- Audit trail for deletions

### Right to Erasure Implementation

- User data deletion requests
- Cascading deletions
- Deletion verification

---

## 8.6 Privacy by Design

### Core Principles

- Proactive not reactive
- Privacy as the default
- Privacy embedded into design
- Full functionality without privacy trade-offs
- End-to-end security
- Visibility and transparency
- Respect for user privacy

### Developer Implementation

- Privacy impact assessments
- Data protection in system architecture
- Consent management
- User preference handling

---

## 8.7 Regulatory Requirements and Technical Controls

### Key Regulations

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

### Translating Requirements to Code

- Access control implementation
- Audit logging requirements
- Data subject rights implementation
- Cross-border data transfer controls

### Secure Coding for Compliance

- Input validation for personal data
- Secure storage patterns
- Consent verification in code
- Privacy-preserving APIs

---

## 8.8 Testing Data Protection Controls

### Testing Approaches

- Data leakage testing
- Encryption validation
- Access control testing
- Deletion verification testing

### Compliance Verification

- Automated compliance scanning
- Privacy control auditing
- Penetration testing for data exposure
