## Applicable legislation

 * GDPR

## GDPR introduction
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU law which is concerned with data protection and privacy of EU citizens.

It spells out how organisations can process personal data (similar to PII) and what the rights of the data subjects are.

The law was a landmark law in the privacy field and is used as a blueprint in other countries.

### Scope of GDPR
GDPR will apply to your organisation if:
 * You process "personal data" of "data subjects" which are in the European Union
     * This means your organisation does not need to be in the EU for GDPR to apply. It is sufficient to provide services to data subjects within the EU


### Important definitions

* Personal data: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)
* Data subject: an identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural perso 
* Processing: any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data


### Under which legal basis can we process personal data?
There are only a couple of reasons why we are allowed to process personal data:

* consent: the data subject gives his consent (e.g. when ordering something online, you also click the "add me to your mailing list" button)
* contractual: the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract (e.g. Amazon processing your name and address so they can ship you what you ordered.)
* legal obligation: the processing is necessary to be able to comply with the law (e.g. A healthcare provider keeping medical records on you in order to comply with healthcare regulations)
* vital interest: processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person (e.g. A hospital processing the personal data of an unconscious person admitted to ER in order to help that person.)
* public interest: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. A commercial entity is unlikely to be able to rely on this legal basis. (e.g. A government agency processing personal data in order to provide statistics or research which benefits society)
* legitimate interest: there is some "legitimate" interest to process the data (might be a commercial interest). This is the most flexible legal basis, but it also must be justified. GDPR specifies a 3 part balancing test:
  1. Purpose test: identify the purpose of processing and decide whether it counts as legitimate interest
  2. Necessity test: consider whether the processing is necessary
  3. Balancing test: consider whether the interests and fundamental rights of the individual override the legitimate interest



### Principles of GDPR

* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: 
  * processing personal data has to be legal, 
  * we've considered how the individuals might be impacted by us processing their personal data,
  * we're open about how we process the personal data
* Purpose limitation
  * we'll only process the personal data for the purpose we declared (so, no reprocessing of the personal data for something else afterward)
* Data minimisation
  * only ask for / use the necessary personal data for processing
* Accuracy
  * we need to take steps to ensure the personal data is accurate
* Storage limitation
  * all personal data should have a "retention time", which is reasonable for the kind of processing we do
* Integrity and confidentiality (security)
  * we take adequate measures to ensure the security of the personal data we hold
* Accountability
  * we take responsibility for what we do with the personal data we hold

### Rights of the data subject

* Right to be informed: individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data
* Right of access: individuals can receive a copy of their personal data
* Right to rectification: individuals have the right to have inaccurate data rectified
* Right to erasure (right to be forgotten): individuals have the right to have their data erased (within reason)
* Right to restrict processing: individuals can request restriction or suppression of the processing of their personal data
* Right to data portability: individuals have the right to obtain a (machine readable) copy of their personal data
* Right to object: individuals can object to the processing of their data (within reason)
* Rights related to automated decision making (and profiling): there are additional rights when there is automated decision making based on personal data
