# Module 1. Security Architecture and Threat Modelling

1.1 What is threat modelling?
- Being aware of threat modelling
- Support offered by threat modelling in secure development

1.2 Why should developers be aware of threat modelling?
- Accept inputs from threat models for secure development
- Inputs for secure coding, recommended by regulatory / statutory / legal / contractual / etc requirements. For example requirement 6.3 from PCI-DSS

1.3 Commonly used threat model methods
- Awareness about commonly used threat model methods like STRIDE

1.4 Using data flows and trust boundaries
- Using data flows to identify the interfaces and the security requirements around the interfaces

1.5 Secure by Design Principles - definition and importance
- understanding of security controls at network layer for example network segmentation, firewall ports, reverse proxy 

- understanding of hardening of discrete components for example databases, operating systems, web servers - 
       
- understanding of security of micro-services such as images, image registry, pods and clusters of kubernetes
  
- understanding of security of services such as database-as-a-service, webserver-as-a-service
  
- understanding of privileges for identities such as identity that reads / writes to a database from application context
  
- understanding of security of data such as at rest, in motion, in use, and security controls for data assets
