# Module 1. Security Architecture and Threat Modelling

1.1 What is threat modelling?
- Being aware of threat modelling
- Support offered by threat modelling in secure development

1.2 Why should developers be aware of threat modelling?
- Accept inputs from threat models for secure development
- Inputs for secure coding, recommended by regulatory / statutory / legal / contractual / etc requirements. For example requirement 6.3 from PCI-DSS

1.3 Commonly used threat model methods
- Awareness about commonly used threat model methods like STRIDE

1.4 Using data flows and trust boundaries
- Using data flows to identify the interfaces and the security requirements around the interfaces

1.5 Secure by Design Principles
- understanding of security controls at network layer (network segmentation, ports to be used and so on)
- understanding of hardening of discrete components (like databases, operating systems, web servers, and so on)
- understanding of security of micro-services (images, image registry, pods and clusters of kubernetes, and so on)
- understanding of security of services (database-as-a-service, webserver-as-a-service, and so on)
- understanding of privileges for identities (identity that reads / writes to a database from application context)
- understanding of security of data (at rest, in motion, in use, and security controls for data assets)
