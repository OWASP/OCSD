OCSD curriculum - OWASP Certified Secure-Software Developer

Welcome to the repo for curriculum for OCSD\
The scope of this certification is Web Application Security\.
It is Foundation level exam

This certification program is an answer to the questions, a hiring manager for a developer may have to validate security knowledge of the candidate.\
It is also for the developers who want to showcase their skills in developing secure code.

Remember:\
**** Writing secure code != testing the security of code with tools ****\
**** If developers do not put security in the code, no one else will ****
 

The questions we may want to ask are:\
If I am hiring a web application developer, what are the security related skills I would look for?\
If I were a web application developer what security skills would I like to be validated for?

Generally the topics that we centre our questions around are:\

Authentication and authorisation\
Session Management\
Cryptography (certs, cert pinning, sharing keys, cipher suites)\
DNS entries\
Service discovery\
Firewall rules\
Input data validation\
Output data encoding\
Knowledge about remediating application related security vulnerabilities\
Database and data security concepts\
Error handling\
Secrets handling (where should secrets be stored - code / configuration file / ???) sort of a negative question :-)\
What is SQL Injection\
What is the difference between reflected XSS and persistent XSS\
What is the best way to address XSS\
HTTP Security headers\
Hardening of other HTTP headers\
Privacy - what is PII and its protection\
Threat Modeling\
Logging of security-releated events\

We have a markdown file to develop curriculum for this certification exam, based on the security related questions we ask as a hiring manager and also the security topics that we want validation for as a developer.
