# Authorisation 

## Concepts and Best Practices 

### Session timeout and renewal

The following two mechanisms ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of authenticated sessions.
1. **Session timeout:** The period of inactivity after which a user’s session is automatically terminated or requires re-authentication.
2. **Session renewal (or rotation):**  The act of issuing a new session identifier (token) to reduce the risk of session fixation or theft.


Best practices for session timeout include the following. 
* Use reasonable inactivity timeouts.
* Require Re-authentication After Max Session Lifetime.
* Provide clear user feedback.
* Terminate sessions server-side.

Best practices for session renewal (rotation) include the following. 
* Rotate session IDs after authentication.
* Periodically rotate long-lived tokens.
* Immediately invalidate old tokens.


### Cookie attributes: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite


The following cookie attributes play an important role in secure software development.

* **Secure:**  This cookie attribute ensures that the cookie is only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections and protects the confidentiality and integrity of cookie data during transmission. Without this flag, cookies could be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP, allowing attackers on the same network to intercept or steal session cookies through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
* **HttpOnly:**  Prevents client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) from accessing the cookie.  If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into your web page (via XSS), they could read cookies and hijack sessions. Marking cookies as `HttpOnly` ensures they can only be sent in HTTP requests, not accessed through `document.cookie`.  This helps to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS)–based session theft.
* **SameSite:**  Restricts when cookies are sent with cross-site requests, helping prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and some forms of cross-site tracking.  This protects against CSRF attacks by ensuring cookies aren’t automatically sent with cross-origin requests unless explicitly allowed.
  

### Token vs. cookie-based sessions


In web security, token-based and cookie-based sessions are two different approaches to managing user authentication and maintaining session state. Both aim to verify that a user remains authenticated as they navigate a site or API—but they differ in how they store and transmit that authentication data.
Below is a detailed breakdown of their differences:

* Where session data is stored
* Authentication flow
* Statelessness and scalability


### Logout and re-authentication


### Fixation and hijacking defenses

### RBAC vs. ABAC

Roll-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) are two different styles of access control policies.  

With RBAC, users of a system are assigned roles, and each role has a defined set of permissions. Access decisions are based on what role the user holds.  For example, in an electronic medical record (EMR) platform, a user with the `Nurse` role can view patient charts, and a `Doctor` role can view and update patient charts.

With ABAC, decisions are based on attributes, which can come from the user, resource, action, or environment.  For example, an ABAC policy might allow only employees in the Medical Department with clearance >= 3 to update patient charts while inside the hospital network. Attributes may fall under any of the following categories. 
* User attributes, such as job title, clearance level or department
* Resource attributes like document classification or owner
* Environment attributes, such as time of day, location or device trust level
* Action attributes like including read, write or approve


### Object-level authorisation

Object-Level Authorisation (OLA) is a fine-grained access control mechanism that ensures a user can only access or modify specific objects (records, files, or resources) they are permitted to.

It goes beyond checking whether a user is authenticated or has a general role, such as `Admin` or `User`.
Instead, it checks whether the user owns or has permission for the specific resource they’re trying to access.

Consider the following example.

1. A user with ID 123 requests `/api/orders/456`.

2. The application must check if order 456 belongs to user 123.

3. Even if the user is authenticated, they should not see or modify someone else’s order.

If this check is missing, it’s known as an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) — a common OWASP Top 10 vulnerability.

A developer can follow the following steps to enforce OLA.

1. **Authenticate the user:** Identify who is making the request (via session, token, etc.)
2. Extract the object identifier, such as the order ID, document ID, or record ID.
3. **Check object ownership or permissions:** Confirm the user has rights to that specific object.
4. **Enforce least privilege:** Users can only access what they truly need.

### Security of authorisation tokens (JWT etc)


### Horizontal vs vertical privilege escalation


### Effective testing of access control
